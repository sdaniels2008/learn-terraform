# Terraform Docker Provider

Hashicorp Terraform does support Docker as a provider. It allows Terraform to manage Docker containers, images, and networks as well as create, update, and destroy Docker resources using declarative configuration files. This provider plugin enables users to manage their Docker infrastructure alongside their other infrastructure resources using the same Terraform workflows.
